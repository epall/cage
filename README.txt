CAGE is a gesture recognition designed for the the eZ430-Chronos wristwatch.
This system allows users to make gestures using their hand (equipped with a
wristwatch) that control their PC. The system consists of a library for
interfacing with the wireless system, a suite of applications that leverage
the library on the desktop, and custom firmware for the wristwatch.

Applications will eventually include mouse control, slideshow control, and
character data entry. If time permits, we will develop software that allows
interaction with the wristwatch itself using gestures, without the aid of
the desktop.
